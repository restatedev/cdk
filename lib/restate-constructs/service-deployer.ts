/**
 * This construct implements a custom CloudFormation resource provider that handles deploying Lambda-based service
 * handlers with a Restate environment. It is used internally by the Cloud and self-hosted Restate environment
 * constructs and not intended for direct use by end users of Restate.
 *
 * This functionality is implemented as a custom resource so that we are notified of any updates to service handler
 * functions: by creating a CloudFormation component, we can model the dependency that any changes to the handlers need
 * to be communicated to the registrar. Without this dependency, CloudFormation might perform an update deployment that
 * triggered by a Lambda handler code or configuration change, and the Restate environment would be unaware of it.
 *
 * You can share the same instance across multiple service registries provided the configuration options are compatible
 * (e.g. the Restate environments it needs to communicate with for deployment are all accessible via the same VPC and
 * Security Groups).
